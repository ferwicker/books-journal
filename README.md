## Built With

## Motivation
As an avid reader, I have been a Goodreads user for years. While the app does reasonably well in some areas, and has some pretty cool features (such as the ability to use the camera to scan a book to search its info), it has some major pain points that have not been addressed in years.

### **Goodreads pain points**
The main pain points for Goodreads users identified are:
- *Shelves*: Goodreads has three default shelves: Want to Read, Read and Currently Reading. That's it. Users can create custom shelves, but for a book to be saved to them , it first needs to be saved to one of the three 'base' bookshelves. This is truly a pain and it makes management of large collections convoluted and complicated.
- *Groups*: Goodreads groups remind me of forums my mum used to frequent in the nineties, on our big old desktop in 'the computer room'. Yes, we're that old folks... Jokes aside, this is a major pain point.
- *UI*: Goodreads's UI looks like it has not had a major update since the oughts. It is DULL and crowded. The mobile app UI is somewhat better, they've removed much of the useless functionalities, but it is still quite outdated.

### Alternatives to Goodreads
- *Storygraph*: a nice alternative that focuses on tailored book recommendations. It encourages users to import their Goodreads data. It uses user generated 'mood' tags to help readers choose books. The UI is very simple, a bit too much so, and it is not the simplest to use. It also has 4 'base' shelves (they've added a 'did-not-finish' shelf to Goodreads base shelves). The review 'form' is very detailed, but that also makes it overwhelming. 
- *Bookly*: this is a more 'playful' kind of platform, focusing on a cartoon 'assistant', daily reading goals, and stats. It has a LOT of paid only features. On the bright side, it allows you to add shelves or 'collections' freely.
- *BookSloth*:
